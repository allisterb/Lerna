## Lerna

Lerna is an online learning environment that features a virtual pedagogical and learner resource agent
that uses a conversational user interface to interact with students. Students converse with Lerna just as they would with a human teacher's assistant and Lerna uses natural language understanding (NLU) to understand and respond to questions and instructions and deliver individual tutoring programs. Lerna is an electronic adjunct to traditional instruction with capabilities like:
- An intelligent tutoring system that simulates and retains many of the advantages of one-one
personalized instruction without requiring a human instructor to be present.
- Help students understand and monitor their own metacognitive processes and use effective
learning strategies by providing electronic aides like study journals, checklists, etc.
- Help students with their class schedules, provide reminders for class times, exams, parent-teacher meetings and other events.
- Set and coordinate student goals with a teacher’s learning goals.
- Collect data that teachers and parents can use to monitor their child’s progress.

Lerna is a purely browser-based solution and does not require any special apps or hardware. All students need to access it is a internet connection and browser. Lerna is multimodal and interacts with students using both text and speech. The Lerna interface is a simple line-oriented conversational user
interface that does not use complex GUI widgets and can reduce the need to use assistive technology
like screen readers for students with vision or other disabilities.
